# Why are women more likely to die from heart attacks than men?

## Brief summary
Women can have higher heart-attack mortality because of a combination of factors, not one single cause:

- Women are often older at presentation and have more comorbidities (for example diabetes, hypertension, heart failure), which increases baseline risk.
- Women are more likely to present without classic chest pain, which can delay recognition and treatment.
- Women with STEMI are less likely to receive timely reperfusion and may experience longer total ischemic time.
- Women may be less likely to receive some guideline-directed therapies in routine practice.
- MI biology can differ by sex (for example, more MINOCA in women), which can complicate diagnosis and treatment pathways.

Overall, current evidence supports a **multifactorial explanation**: risk profile + symptom differences + treatment/timing gaps + biological heterogeneity.

## Key findings from the literature

1. **Presentation differences are clinically important.**
Women hospitalized with MI were more likely than men to present without chest pain (42.0% vs 30.7%), and younger women without chest pain had higher in-hospital mortality than younger men.

2. **Women often present with higher baseline risk.**
Large registry studies consistently show women are older at ACS presentation and have more comorbidities, which explains a substantial part of crude mortality differences.

3. **Time-to-treatment gaps persist in STEMI care.**
Multiple contemporary PCI/STEMI registries report longer symptom-to-door and reperfusion delays in women, with associated higher short-term mortality in STEMI cohorts.

4. **Care delivery differences still matter.**
Women are less likely to receive some guideline-based secondary prevention regimens in real-world ACS care, which contributes to worse long-term outcomes in some cohorts.

5. **Pathophysiology differs in a meaningful subgroup.**
MINOCA is much more common in women than men (10.5% vs 3.4% in one large registry), reinforcing that sex-specific diagnostic pathways are important.

## Note for this dashboard context
Your dataset contains **12,844 New York State heart-attack patients from 1993**. The mechanisms above are still relevant conceptually, but treatment standards and awareness have changed since 1993. Interpretation should therefore separate:

- historical care patterns in the dataset, and
- what contemporary evidence says now.
